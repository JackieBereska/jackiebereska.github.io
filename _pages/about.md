I'm Jackie, a PhD Candidate at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, specializing in the application of machine learning to medical imaging and segmentation. My research aims to enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes through advanced AI techniques.

### research 

My research focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for medical imaging and segmentation, with an emphasis on improving clinical outcomes and decision-making processes. Specifically, I am engaged in:

- Developing advanced radiomics and imaging biomarkers for risk assessment and treatment planning.
- Utilizing AI for accurate and automated segmentation of complex tumors.
- Implementing self-supervised learning architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy.
- Enhancing the integration of AI solutions into clinical practice.

I am an active contributor to multidisciplinary collaborations aimed at integrating AI solutions into clinical practice, striving to bridge the gap between technological advancements and their practical application in healthcare. Additionally, I am committed to mentoring emerging researchers in the field, guiding them through projects that combine AI innovation with clinical relevance.

### beyond research

When I'm not diving into the intricacies of neural networks, you might find me:

- Going to the gym and practicing yoga to maintain physical and mental well-being.
- Cooking vegan food and experimenting in the kitchen, creating delicious and healthy meals.
- Cuddling with my two chihuahuas, Cicchetti and Pancetta. 
- Traveling off the beaten path, exploring unique destinations and cultures.
- Learning languages, broadening my communication skills and cultural understanding.
- Redecorating my house for the millionth time, much to the dismay of my husband...
